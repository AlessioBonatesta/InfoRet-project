This repository contains the project developed for the Information Retreival course of the University of Milan.

The only note to keep in mind when looking at the file . ipynb and its report is that the experiments performed also involved the analysis of Googleâ€™s Bert model (as noted in the notebook file). 
The reason it is not mentioned in the report is that the high computational cost for fine tuning the transformer-based model prevented me from performing an adequate analysis that makes the experiment comparable with the others performed. Nevertheless I thought it was worth a try.
